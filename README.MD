# Leaf
Leaf is the re-writing of my old IDE,"Wide", from scratch.This time,the syntax highlighting works and is implemented in
plain Java.The library used for richtexting of text is RichTextFX.
## What has been done
The current version is more of a beta, I'm only testing stuff like working of Syntax-highlighting, correct Tabbing etc.
So, in a way,nothing specific, you can download and run the tests to see them working
## Languages
Supports syntax highlighting for C, Java and Python
